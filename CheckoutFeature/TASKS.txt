Background

A major supplier of retail systems will make changes to its checkout solution.
The core functionality of the customer's solution is registration of goods at checkout and calculation of amounts to be paid.
The module for calculating prices will now be re-implemented. Several of the customers need a more flexible pricing model.
Your task will be to implement this based on the various requirements presented.
Errors in the price calculation can not occur.
The customer therefore follows a strict development regime with test-driven development.

Task

You must implement a function that calculates the total price of a shopping cart.
For simplicity, the product range consists of only 3 items: rubber gloves, stethoscope and talcum powder.
We use the super-simple PLU codes on A, B and C, respectively.
Items are sent over the assembly line in random order.
The function must be able to take in the goods as they arrive and always have the right price.
You use your own PC, and your favorite IDE.
The function is written in C # using TDD. This function should include a list of items (PLU code, and quantity).
There may be several elements of the same PLU in the list.
It must return the price for the entire shopping cart.

PLU A
-Rubber gloves (sold in pairs)
-Unit price SEK 59.90 (per pair)
-When buying 2 pairs, you get the third for free

PLU B
-Stethoscope
-Unit price SEK 399
-3 pcs for DKK 999

PLU C - Talc (sold in bulk)
-Unit price 19.54 per kg

-The smallest unit you operate with is 1 øre
-We can only pay in full kroner
